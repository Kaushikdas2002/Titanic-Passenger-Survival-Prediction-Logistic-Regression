# Titanic-Passenger-Survival-Prediction-Logistic-Regression

## Overview
This project focuses on predicting passenger survival on the Titanic using logistic regression. The sinking of the Titanic is one of the most infamous shipwrecks in history. This project aims to develop a logistic regression model to predict the likelihood of a passenger surviving based on various features such as age, gender, class, and more.

## Introduction
The sinking of the Titanic resulted in a tragic loss of lives. This project uses the Titanic dataset to build a logistic regression model that predicts whether a passenger survived or not. Logistic regression is a suitable algorithm for binary classification tasks like predicting survival.

## Dataset
The dataset used for training and testing the model is the famous Titanic dataset, available on platforms like Kaggle. It includes information about passengers such as age, gender, class, and whether they survived or not.

## Results
The model's performance on the test set is as follows:

Accuracy: 91%  
Precision: 91%  
Recall: 91%  
F1 Score: 91%
